## The Julia programming language

[Article](https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/10/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-the-julia-programming-language/)

For most data scientists, Python is the language of choice due to its ecosystem, interactivity, and rapid <br/>
development cycle. In past years, for scientists who's job was to simulate the atmosphere and design nuclear <br/>
weapons, Fortran was the language of choice. This language has dominated the market because their compilers <br/>
are available and can take good advantage of the largest supercomputers

The Author of the article spoke about how he predicted the progamming language 'Julia' would take over <br/> 
as the new tool scientists would use to tackle large numerical problems. Years later he realized that he <br/>
was wrong. He did not truly understand why the language took off the way it did. <br/>

Originally, the problem for data scientitsts was that a programming language like Python was not easily <br/>
scalable and could not be made more realistic. This leads to scientists re-writing the code in C which is <br/>
inherently faster. 

The reason so many scientists are raving about Julia is becuase its level of collaborative use and how easy it <br/>
is to reuse other people's code. The Julia community loves how Julia has nice abstractions that allow very <br/>
general code. Julia incorporates the work of others and allows them to write code that can be used by others <br/>
in unforeseen ways.
