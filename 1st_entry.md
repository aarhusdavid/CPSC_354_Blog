## Relation between fib() and Haskell programming

I could see how recursion used in the fibonacci sequence played a roll in our Haskell <br/>
programming when we started coding for functional Programming. <br/>

Example 1 <br/>

'-- addition
add :: NN -> NN -> NN
add O n = n
add (S n) m = S (add n m)
-- add (S O) (S (S O))'
