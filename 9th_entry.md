[Article](https://medium.com/inc./welcome-to-the-no-code-software-revolution-6b75ee967df7)

As many may agree, software has been taking over the world. You can see it everywhere, from the internet, mobile <br/>
devices, Artifical intelligence, augmented Reality, etc.Software will be the underlying framework for all innovation <br/>
for years to come. 

Over the years there have been key transformations in the software industry. For example, Mac OS and Windows operating systems <br/>
were the first to provide visual interfaces and experiences with computing. Then Software began to make its way as a Service <br/>
Business Model. Then afterthat came other innovations like Cloud Computing, Apps, Quicker development, and the growth of application <bf/>
use for startups in all industries. However, this developed a dependency on software for alot of companies. 

Then along came the "No-Code Revolution". This movement involved software applications that stream-lined the process of software <br/>
usability which is becoming very attractive for users. These features include drag and drop widgets, filters and data queries, <br/>
use of API, and over appeal to people who are not as tech savy.

Here is a quote from the article:

> According to Salesforce, 52% of IT departments say that IT-related skill gaps are a big problem for their organization.
 That’s why 74% of the IT leaders who run these departments say they plan to push application development into the business
 units they serve. The problem is that this approach isn’t solving the root cause of the issue — that talented developers are
 tough to find and expensive to pay. 

It is interesting to think what will come of this movement and if eventually all applications will be so easily usable by the mass <bt/>
Will today's highly skilled coders become a thing of the past? The disruption will be something to watch our for in years to <br/>
come.
