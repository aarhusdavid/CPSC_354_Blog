## Reverseible computing

A topic of discussion that came up in class notes was "reversible computing" <br/>
So I decided to look it up on Google to see what I could find

This is an article that I read a little into [The Future of Computing Depends on Making It Reversible](https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/hardware/the-future-of-computing-depends-on-making-it-reversible)

It began talking about how computers have, over the years, made rapid improvements <br/>
due to Moore's Law. Moores law (the exponential increase over time in the number of transistors that can be fabricated on an integrated circuit of a given size)

One day however, a new computer will be any cheaper or faster than any of its predecessors. <br/>
At this point progress will be haulted.

Though, in 1961, a physicist named Rolf Landauer published a paper titled, <br/>
"Irreversibility and Heat Generation in the Computing Process". He argued that the <br/>
 logically irreversible character of conventional computational operations has direct <br/>
 implications for the thermodynamic behavior of a device that is carrying out those <br/>
 operations.

Now I am not totally sure what that means haha but the article stated that he <br/> 
was touching on the idea that fundamental laws of physics are reversible.

### The game of billards example

This is how he explains it with a game of billards:

'If you were to make a movie of the balls bouncing off one another and the bumpers,<br/>
 the movie would look normal whether you ran it backward or forward: The collision <br/>
 physics would be the same, and you could work out the future configuration of the balls<br/>
 from their past configuration or vice versa equally easily'

He used this example to example how we never truly erase information from a computer. Whenever we overwrite a bit of information with a new value, the previous infomation <br/>
may be lost but has not been destroyed. It is then pushed to the machine's thermal <br/> 
environment where it becomes randomized information and produces heat.

He then explains how this is revelant to our computers today:

'Today’s computers rely on erasing information all the time—so much so that every <br/>
 single active logic gate in conventional designs destructively overwrites its previous <br/>
 output on every clock cycle, wasting the associated energy. A conventional computer is,<br/>
 essentially, an expensive electric heater that happens to perform a small amount of <br/>
 computation as a side effect.'
