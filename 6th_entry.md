## Resemblance between Abstract Reduction Systems and Funcional Dependencies <br/>

In class today we begaon looking at some of the questions on our practice <br/>
test. The ones we went over were about Abstract Reduction Systems. This <br/> 
is a concept that specifies a set of objects and rules can be used to <br/>
modify them. 

When we were working through the problem it made me think of Functional <br/>
Dependencies from my CPSC 408 class in Database systems. Functional <br/>
Dependencies. A functional dependency is a relationship between two attributes <br/>
and other non-key attributes within a table (Google Def)

Below is a example question from my CPSC 408 course

'Find all keys of the relation R(ABCDEFG) with functional dependencies
AB → C, CD → E, EF → G, FG → E, DE → C, and BC → A'

"ABFG" is a key to this relation. 

For ARS we were looking at the set of rules below

ba -> bbaa <br/>
aa -> <br/>
ba -> ab <br/>
ab -> ba <br/>

To see how we could reduce string such as abba and bababa.

Maybe it was just me, but I felt there was alot of correlation in the <br/>
thought process for both problems so maybe there was a correlation <br/>
between ARS and Functional Dependencies.
