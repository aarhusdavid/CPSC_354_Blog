## Downloading BNFC

This was one of the more frustrating moments of the class. It took forever to <br/>
download BNFC and make sure it was operating properly. After going to office hours <br/>
I came to realize that the error I had while compiling my calculator file was that <br/>
there was some white space that I was not accounting for. This caused my code <br/> 
to not compile correctly. After that however It was fixed. My Friend Vinny had <br/> 
troubles downloading the BNFC as well and had to go to office hours to ask for help <br/>
It seemed like alot of people had issues with it so whenever you get to the point <br/>
in class that you have to download it, make sure you stay on top of it rather than <br/>
putting it off.
